# ArrayLists - Forge fix
ArrayLists is an MCreator plugin designed to store multiple variables in one.

What i did is just modifying the variables.yaml to make it work onto Forge 1.20.1

**NOTE: For this to work you must have your workspace set the Java JDK to 21. 17 will not work for this.**

**NOTE: Don't ask me for a variable save fix. i found somehow a tweak that works for now. create a BuiltIn variable (ex. Number) call it something like _placeholder and everytime you add/remove a thing in your list change this variables (could be anything but still you need to change it.)**

**NOTE: When you do plugins for MCreator don't COPY/PASTE from newer version**
